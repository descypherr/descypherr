## Hi there, I'm Ishmael 👋🏾

Cybersecurity student at Eduvos focused on becoming a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst. I'm building hands-on experience in threat detection, log analysis, and incident response.

## 🛡️ Professional Focus

My interest lies in defensive security—monitoring systems, analyzing suspicious activity, and improving detection capabilities before incidents escalate.

I'm actively developing skills in:
* SIEM monitoring and log analysis
* Threat detection engineering
* Understanding attacker TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK)
* Incident response documentation and playbooks

## 🎓 Education & Certifications

* Cybersecurity Student — Eduvos
* Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate
* Fortinet Certified Associate (FCA)
* TryHackMe Pre-Security Path Completed

## 🚀 Current Projects

I'm building practical, SOC-style projects including:
* Log analysis labs
* Detection rule creation
* Incident response playbooks
* Threat hunting documentation

Every project is documented to reflect real-world analyst workflows.

## 📌 Goal

Secure a junior SOC analyst role and continuously grow into a highly skilled defensive security professional.
